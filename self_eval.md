# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

I feel pretty confident!  I feel like this one is pretty self explanitory!

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

Also confident.  I just keep reminding myself to use two ampersands to show that a question is being asked. 

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

I think i feel most confident with if statements. After try coding weekend and mod0, that one has really stuck.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

I think I spent about an hour and a half on this assignment, which did line up pretty will with my assumption!

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I think just practicing/making sure that the conditionals stick for final exam is good.  I think they are pretty self explanitory, but a little extra review will be helpful.  

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

At this point, not a lot on conditionals!  If I do have questions, I'll be sure to reach out to my small group and or the larger group if needed!
